## Projects

### Project 1: JMeter for Integration & Performance Testing

I aimed to practice and understand how to conduct effective performance tests.

  - **PerformanceTesting_1**: This file contains a small performance test for the public API at [Restful Booker](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/apidoc/index.html).
  - **PerformanceTesting_2**: This file contains a more extensive performance test for the public API at [DemoBlaze](https://www.demoblaze.com/). For this test, I manually executed the tests while JMeter recorded the steps. I then modified some parameters and code to simulate different randomized "users" (threads) and executed the tests to check for any issues or failures.

### Project 2: WebGoat for Security Testing

I completed a few chapters of WebGoat, including:

  - **WebGoat_1.txt**: A3-Injection
  - **WebGoat_2.txt**: A1-Broken Access Control (Insecure Direct Object References), A7-Identity & Authentication Failures (Password Reset, Insecure Login)
