# Testing Projects Repository

Welcome to the Testing Projects Repository! This repository contains a collection of various extra work and projects that I have completed on the subject of software testing.

## Projects

### Project 1: JMeter for Integration & Performance Testing

I aimed to practice and understand how to conduct effective performance tests.

  - **PerformanceTesting_1**: This file contains a small performance test for the public API at [Restful Booker](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/apidoc/index.html).
  - **PerformanceTesting_2**: This file contains a more extensive performance test for the public API at [DemoBlaze](https://www.demoblaze.com/). For this test, I manually executed the tests while JMeter recorded the steps. I then modified some parameters and code to simulate different randomized "users" (threads) and executed the tests to check for any issues or failures.

### Project 2: WebGoat for Security Testing

I completed a few chapters of WebGoat, including:

  - **WebGoat_1.txt**: A3-Injection
  - **WebGoat_2.txt**: A1-Broken Access Control (Insecure Direct Object References), A7-Identity & Authentication Failures (Password Reset, Insecure Login)

### Project 3: End-to-end (E2E) testing with Java using ChromeDriver
In this project, I performed end-to-end (E2E) testing using ChromeDriver with Java to test various scenarios on two different open-source public APIs.

  - **Testing_1(E2E)**: For this test, I used [Demo Web Shop](https://demowebshop.tricentis.com/). The test navigated the site, selecting products, adding items to the cart, and checked the functionality of features.
  - **Testing_2(E2E)**: For this test, I used [Demo QA](https://demoqa.com/).This test was made mainly to practise practicing writing XPath expressions and to plat with different buttons and features on the website to help check usability and identify potential bugs.
